# Baseline application-wide Content-Security-Policy, deployed in Report-Only
# mode: browsers evaluate the policy and report violations (once a report
# endpoint is wired up) but enforce nothing, so rendering cannot break.
# Tune the policy against observed violations, then flip
# `content_security_policy_report_only` off to enforce it.

# Session-stable nonce for permitted inline scripts (the importmap JSON + shim,
# auto-nonced by importmap-rails).
#
# The nonce is stable across a session's requests so Turbo snapshot restores
# don't replay a stale nonce and trip CSP. It's the HMAC of a stable cookie
# value keyed by the server secret: the cookie is client-settable, but the
# client can't predict the resulting nonce without knowing secret_key_base.
#
# Writebook sets no per-session verification cookie, so the lightweight
# nonce_id cookie — set on first visit, present for every session including
# unauthenticated ones — is the sole identifier.

  # these ENV knobs let an admin allow additional hosts without editing this file
  # (and without which enforcement would break their legitimate integrations).

  # expressions, e.g.

  # Leave them unset (the default) to keep each directive at :self only.

  # single source token and make Rails raise InvalidDirectiveError on every
  # request — a site-wide 500 even in report-only mode. Splitting on `;` yields
  # valid tokens instead; Rails still validates each one, so no injection is
